# Riverpod skeleton

Project skeleton for Flutter with Riverpod.

## Getting Started

You can simply run `flutter pub get` to start.
And after that, run the code-generator with `flutter pub run build_runner watch`.

## Roadmaps
- [x] Add Riverpod: for state management
- [x] Add Go Route: for routing
- [x] Add Freezed: for immutable classes
- [x] Add Isar: for local db
- [ ] Add Dio: for network requests
- [ ] Add Catcher: for error handling
- [x] To consider nested UI and routing for deep linking
- [ ] To consider responsive design
- [ ] To consider localization
- [ ] Research for testing
