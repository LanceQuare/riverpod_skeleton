# Riverpod skeleton

Project skeleton for Flutter with Riverpod.

## Getting Started

You can simply run `flutter pub get` to start.
And after that, run the code-generator with `flutter pub run build_runner watch`.

## Roadmaps
- [ ] Add Riverpod: for state management
- [ ] Add Go Route: for routing
- [ ] Add Freezed: for immutable classes
- [ ] Add Isar: for local db
- [ ] Add Dio: for network requests
- [ ] Research for testing
